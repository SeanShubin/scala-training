Hands on Scala training

I will be giving 4 training sessions on Scala, 2 in Westlake, 1 in Santa Barbara, and one in Westwood.
Each training session is 4 hours long, however, if more time is allocated we can go into more detail.
I will be scheduling a time for each of these soon, but feel free to send me a schedule that works for you.
The room we meet in will need a good projector setup.

There are 4 prerequisites, the first one is most important, the others would be nice

(prerequisite 1) Make sure you can run the scala training project from maven
    checkout the code at
        //cj/scala-training

    make sure you can run the tests and create the executable jar file
        cd 00-search/implemented
        mvn package

    run the smoke test
        ./prod-run.sh

    this will start a webserver, the last line of the output should be
        SUCCESS: make sure we can search for an item by color and name

    open up chrome and navigate to
        http://localhost:15000/search?query=black%20shirt
    make sure you have a list of skus

backup plan
    try to get at least this far, let me know what problems you are having and I can try to help
    otherwise it will slow down the training

(prerequisite 2) Set up the scala-training project in your favorite integrated development environment
    use the maven project at //cj/scala-training/00-search/baseline/pom.xml
    run the tests in module "core"
    the tests in "basics" should succeed, the others will fail, this is your starting point
backup plan
    there is always vi

(prerequisite 3) Install latest scala (2.10.1 last time I checked) from http://www.scala-lang.org
add scala-2.10.1/bin to your path
you should be able to type 'scala' at the command line and get something like this:
    Welcome to Scala version 2.10.1 (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.6.0_25).
    Type in expressions to have them evaluated.
    Type :help for more information.
backup plan
    I can help you install scala during the training

(prerequisite 4) Make sure your wireless works
backup plan
    If you managed prerequisites 1-3, you won't need your wireless
    Hopefully there is a wired network connection somewhere in the room
    You could pair for the interactive portions of the training
    You could watch others do interactive portions during the training and do them yourself later
