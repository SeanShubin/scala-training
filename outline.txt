//cj/scala-training/00-search/implemented/
    Start with a sample working implementation
        mvn package
        ./prod-run.sh
        http://localhost:15000/search?query=red+scarf
    If this does not work, it is something with the environment rather than the code

//cj/scala-training/00-search/baseline/
    Implementations have been removed
    The tests in com.seanshubin.scala.training.basics show you how to do most of what you will need
    Refer to //cj/scala-training/00-search/implemented/ if you get stuck
    If you look at implementations, be sure you understand them
        ask if you don't understand
        don't cut/paste
        don't memorize

//cj/scala-training/01-option/baseline/
    Same as //cj/scala-training/00-search/implemented/, but the file format has changed
    You will have to make color optional
    Use the Option type rather than null
    Refer to the //cj/scala-training/01-option/implemented/ if you get stuck
    But be sure you understand what you are seeing
        ask if you don't understand
        don't cut/paste
        don't memorize

//cj/scala-training/01-option/implemented/
    Final working implementation
        mvn package
        ./prod-run.sh
        http://localhost:15000/search?query=red+scarf
        http://localhost:15000/search?query=scarf
